# IWAC Application Refactoring Roadmap

## 1. Establish a Visualization Component Framework

**Issue:** The visualization components share significant duplicate code for tooltips, resize handling, data processing, and lifecycle management.

**Improvement:**
- Create a proper inheritance model extending the BaseVisualization component
- Extract common visualization logic into shared hooks/utilities
- Standardize the component API (props, events, methods)

**Implementation steps:**
1. Refine the BaseVisualization component to handle more common functionality 
2. Create visualization-specific hooks:
   - ✅ useTooltip - Completed
   - ✅ useD3Resize - Completed with proper TypeScript support, debouncing, and cleanup. Successfully implemented across all visualization components.
   - ✅ useDataProcessing - Completed with comprehensive data processing utilities including filtering, grouping, and time-based processing. Successfully implemented in CountryDistribution, IndexDistribution, and LanguageDistribution.
3. Update each visualization component to leverage the shared code
   - ✅ IndexDistribution - Updated to use useTooltip, useD3Resize, and useDataProcessing
   - ✅ LanguageDistribution - Updated to use useTooltip, useD3Resize, and useDataProcessing
   - ✅ CountryDistribution - Updated to use useTooltip, useD3Resize, and useDataProcessing
   - ✅ TimelineDistribution - Updated to use useTooltip and useD3Resize
   - ✅ TypeDistribution - Updated to use useTooltip and useD3Resize
   - ✅ WordDistribution - Updated to use useTooltip and useD3Resize
4. Document the component API for consistency

## 2. Consolidate D3.js Integration

**Issue:** Each visualization component implements D3.js integration differently, making maintenance difficult.

**Improvement:**
- Create a standardized D3.js wrapper/factory for the application
- Separate D3.js rendering logic from component business logic
- ✅ Implement standardized resize handling with useD3Resize hook - Completed and verified across all visualization components

**Implementation steps:**
1. ✅ Create standardized resize handling with useD3Resize hook - Completed and verified
2. Create a D3 service/factory with standardized methods

4. Implement a consistent data transformation approach
5. Update visualization components to use the new abstraction

## 3. Streamline the Translation System

**Issue:** The translation system is complex, verbose, and inconsistently implemented.

- ✅ Improve store subscription cleanup in components

**Implementation steps:**
1. ✅ Implement proper store subscription cleanup (demonstrated in CountryDistribution)
2. Create a consistent store factory pattern
3. Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all stores
4. Create utilities for handling store subscriptions in components
5. Consider implementing derived stores for computed values

## 5. Implement a Robust Error Handling Strategy

**Issue:** Error handling is inconsistent across the application.

**Improvement:**
- Establish a centralized error handling approach
- Make error handling more user-friendly
- ✅ Implement proper error handling in visualization components

**Implementation steps:**
1. ✅ Implement comprehensive error handling in visualization components (demonstrated in CountryDistribution)
2. Create an error handling service
3. Standardize try/catch patterns in async operations
4. Implement proper error boundaries in components
5. Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options

## 6. Extract and Standardize Data Processing Logic

**Issue:** Data processing is tightly coupled with visualization components.

**Improvement:**
- Separate data processing from visualization rendering
- Create reusable data transformers and utilities
- ✅ Implement useDataProcessing hook with standardized data processing functions

**Implementation steps:**
1. ✅ Create useDataProcessing hook with standardized functions:
   - filterItems for consistent filtering
   - groupAndCount for aggregation
   - groupHierarchically for nested data
   - processTimeData for time-based analysis
2. ✅ Implement standardized data transformation utilities
3. ✅ Add TypeScript interfaces for data processing
4. ✅ Update components to use the new data services:
   - CountryDistribution
   - IndexDistribution
   - LanguageDistribution
5. Add unit tests for data processing logic

## 7. Modernize CSS Architecture

**Issue:** CSS is a mix of global styles and component-scoped styles with duplication.

**Improvement:**
- Implement a more structured CSS architecture
- Reduce style duplication

**Implementation steps:**
1. Organize theme variables more systematically
2. Create a design system with reusable components
3. Standardize component styling approaches
4. Implement CSS utility classes for common patterns

## 8. Enhance TypeScript Integration

**Issue:** TypeScript usage is inconsistent and sometimes too permissive.

**Improvement:**
- Strengthen TypeScript typings throughout the application
- Consolidate type definitions
- ✅ Improve TypeScript support in hooks and components

**Implementation steps:**
1. ✅ Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for hooks (demonstrated in useD3Resize and useDataProcessing)
2. ✅ Improve component TypeScript definitions (demonstrated in CountryDistribution)
3. Establish stricter TypeScript configurations
4. Create a centralized types directory structure
5. Replace any types with more specific interfaces
6. Add proper generics for reusable components

## 9. Improve Component Architecture

**Issue:** Component interfaces and behaviors are not consistently designed.

**Improvement:**
- Standardize component interfaces
- Improve component composition
- ✅ Implement proper lifecycle management

**Implementation steps:**
1. ✅ Implement proper component lifecycle management (demonstrated in CountryDistribution)
2. Document clear component APIs
3. Break large components into smaller, focused ones
4. Implement proper component composition patterns
5. Create reusable UI component library

1. ✅ Implement debouncing for resize events (completed in useD3Resize)
2. Implement data caching strategies
3. Optimize D3.js rendering approaches
4. Add virtualization for large datasets
5. Implement proper loading states and progressive rendering

## 13. Improve Testing Infrastructure

**Issue:** Limited or no testing infrastructure visible in the codebase.

2. Implement unit tests for utility functions and data processors
3. Add component testing for UI components
4. Implement integration tests for visualization components

## 14. Documentation Enhancements

**Issue:** Documentation exists but could be more integrated with the codebase.

**Improvement:**

2. Create a developer guide for extending visualizations
3. Document component APIs thoroughly
4. Add inline code examples

This roadmap organizes refactoring efforts from most critical to least critical, focusing on improving maintainability and modularity. Each step builds upon the previous ones, creating a systematic approach to enhancing the application's architecture.
